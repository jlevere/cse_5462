# Project 1: Multicast Server for Receiving and Printing Key-Value Pairs in C

## Intro

This project implements a server that listens for key-value pair messages over [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast#IP) using UDP sockets. 

The server joins a multicast group, receives messages from a client, and prints the key-value pairs in a neatly formatted manner with each key and value displayed in 20-character fields.
